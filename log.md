# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished a Mobile First website using a crash course video about HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** Watching the HTML & CSS Crash Course helped me refresh my knowledge on Front-end basics such as semantic HTML, media queries and learned a bit of SASS. A CSS preprocessor which enables use of variables and nested rules.
