# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished a Mobile First website using a crash course video about HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** Watching the HTML & CSS Crash Course helped me refresh my knowledge on Front-end basics such as semantic HTML, media queries and learned a bit of SASS. A CSS preprocessor which enables use of variables and nested rules. 

### Day 2: July 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished an unresponsive Photo Gallery with blur effect on images using HTML, CSS & Flexbox as the layout

**Thoughts:** I refreshed myself with common CSS rules and tried to right-align a navbar using CSS Flexbox rules and achieved it by using "margin-left: auto" on the list item tags within a div that has a flex layout. I'm satisfied with the results even though I do want to make it responsive using media queries but I'll try to implement it later on. 

### Day 3: July 28, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished making the Photo Gallery website responsive using Media Queries
**Link to work**: [https://codepen.io/navimarcial/full/qBmxPdz]

**Thoughts:** It took a  bit of an unconventional approach to make it work. Particularly on the navbar section, I had to use the :nth-child pseudo-selector to position the list items. But I'm happy that it works! I'll soon implement the hamburger menu when resizing the screen smaller.
