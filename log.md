# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished a Mobile First website using a crash course video about HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** Watching the HTML & CSS Crash Course helped me refresh my knowledge on Front-end basics such as semantic HTML, media queries and learned a bit of SASS. A CSS preprocessor which enables use of variables and nested rules. 

### Day 2: July 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished an unresponsive Photo Gallery with blur effect on images using HTML, CSS & Flexbox as the layout

**Thoughts:** I refreshed myself with common CSS rules and tried to right-align a navbar using CSS Flexbox rules and achieved it by using "margin-left: auto" on the list item tags within a div that has a flex layout. I'm satisfied with the results even though I do want to make it responsive using media queries but I'll try to implement it later on. 

### Day 3: July 28, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished making the Photo Gallery website responsive using Media Queries

**Link to work**: [https://codepen.io/navimarcial/full/qBmxPdz]

**Thoughts:** It took a  bit of an unconventional approach to make it work. Particularly on the navbar section, I had to use the :nth-child pseudo-selector to position the list items. But I'm happy that it works! I'll soon implement the hamburger menu when resizing the screen smaller. 

### Day 4: July 29, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Stats preview card component recreate / redesign (Still in progress)

**Link to work**: [https://codepen.io/navimarcial/full/qBmogPG]

**Thoughts:** I spent most of my time today watching Kevin Powell's explanation about CSS units to better implement responsiveness to my projects. I also took the time to create a workflow setup to prevent re-typing HTML and CSS boilerplates. Lastly, I started to take on the Frontend Mentor challenge and recreate a Stats preview card component and after I complete the card component challenge, I will try to redesign it using my color scheme preference.


### Day 5: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Stats preview card component recreate / redesign (In progress, a bit responsive)

**Link to work**: [https://cdpn.io/navimarcial/debug/qBmogPG/WPALYRdzaLJk]

**Thoughts:** I read more about em units and modified my HTML/CSS structure in order to achieve the exact look of stats preview card component. Instead of adding the image directly on the HTML, I instead used the url() value in CSS as I found it more convenient to style the image. I managed to implement a bit of responsiveness up to a certain screen size and hopefully complete the mobile version tomorrow. 

### Day 6: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Stats preview card component (Responsive)

**Link to work**: [https://imvillarosa.github.io/responsive-preview-card-component-ui/]

**Thoughts:** It took 3 days to achieve the layout and responsiveness to different screen size. I feel like the HTML/CSS structure still needs improvement but it works.
On this challenge, I made use of Flexbox layout to position the elements easier and used relative CSS units such as em, rem, & percentages.

### Day 7: August 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Four card features section (Responsive)

**Link to work**: [https://imvillarosa.github.io/four-card-feature-section/]

**Thoughts:** I managed to finish this Frontend UI challenge quicker than I expected and honestly, I feel like I could have achieved the design on this challenge without using absolute positioning in CSS. Nevertheless, I'm satisfied with the outcome and how I have structured my HTML and CSS by following a Mobile First design. 

### Day 8: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: First progress blog posted and currently working on the boilerplate for my next front end project

**Link to work**: [https://imvillarosa.github.io/fylo-data-storage-component/]

**Link to dev blog**: [https://dev.to/imvillarosa/first-7-days-of-100daysofcode-4ng0]

**Thoughts:** I spent most of today watching lecture videos about selectors and specificity in CSS. It's more of polishing my understanding about it, as I wanted to better implement cleaner structure on my code in the future. Also, I will be doing recaps / review on my progress probably once every week or two in order to keep myself in track. 

### Day 9: August 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: SVG text experiment

**Link to work**: [https://codepen.io/navimarcial/pen/XWRBqyd]

**Thoughts:** Today I dabbled on the CSS properties and did some experiments. I also tried SVGs, I haven't really done much on the challenge but I try to keep myself learning by doing code reviews on other people's work as well. 


### Day 10: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Pottery recreate (In progress, working on last two sections)

**Link to work**: [https://codepen.io/navimarcial/full/VwbGbYy]

**Thoughts:** Flexbox helps create layouts easier and in a short amount of time I almost finished a template that I'm trying to recreate. I tried learning some back-end basics today and introduced myself to relational database. I've learned about how relational database can really be flexible and is ideally for large chunks of information. 

### Day 11: August 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Testing of SaSS partials to implement it on my future projects

**Link to SaSS partials test**: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CSRIqAzl2ND/]

**Thoughts:** I learned more about SASS like use of functions, mixins, and partials. I wasn't able to touch any projects as I was trying to learn how to change the file path location of my .css / Today I also learned more about relational databases. There's three level of architecture which is the external, conceptual and internal level. 

### Day 12: August 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Pottery Recreate (Responsiveness applied, adding sections)

**Link to SaSS partials test**: [https://codepen.io/navimarcial/full/VwbGbYy]

**Thoughts:** I learned more about SASS like use of functions, mixins, and partials. I wasn't able to touch any projects as I was trying to learn how to change the file path location of my .css / Today I also learned more about relational databases.
